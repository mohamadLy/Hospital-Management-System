# Hospital-Management-System
This project is management system forfor managing patients, supplies and staff at the Wellmeadows Hospital.

The Wellmeadows Hospital is specialized in the provision of health care to elderly people. The goal of the project is to develop facilities for managing Patients, Supplies and Staff at the Wellmeadows Hospital. At the current time these functions are supported by separate systems that are not compatible one with the other. Moreover, the existing systems are not accessible using traditional web-browsers and mobile devices. The solution will provide an integrated management environment that will help rationalize and plan for resources. It will also provide a more convenient operation interface.

The Wellmeadows Hospital Management System (HMS) will consist in three main sub-systems: a Patient Management System (PMS), a Medical-Supply Management System (MMS) and a Staff Management System (SMS). The three sub-systems are functionally independent while sharing data. This would allow added functionalities such as balancing staffing needs with wards occupancy.
The initial release of the HMS concerns a sub-set of the PMS according to the requirements in document PMSReq01. This initial release will serve as proof of concept for the whole project and set the ground for further development.
